# SOFAClutchProject

This project includes a component for the SOFA simulator (https://github.com/sofa-framework/sofa) that models the effect of an electrostatic clutch (without slip) on the surface of a thin elastic membrane.

Instructions on how to use the component as well as other suggestions for using SOFA can be found in the Docs directory.
